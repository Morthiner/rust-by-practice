# Small Projects with an Elegant code base
The following questions surface regularly in online Rust discussions, such as:

- I've just completed The Book; what should be my next steps?
- What projects would you recommend to a Rust beginner?
- Looking for small projects with an elegant code base.
- Code that is both readable and conducive to learning.

The typical responses to these questions invariably boil down to one word: **Practice**. This involves engaging in exercises and exploring small, well-crafted Rust projects.

This book aims to facilitate exactly that by gathering relevant resources and presenting them in _Rust By Practice_.

### 1. Ripgrep

The go-to answer for the aforementioned queries often revolves around [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep). While it may not exactly fit the description of a **small** project, it's worth diving into if you're up for a bit of a challenge.

### 2. Building a Text Editor

The tutorial at [`https://www.flenker.blog/hecto/`](https://www.flenker.blog/hecto/) guides you in constructing a text editor from scratch.

### 3. Ncspot

Explore [Ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot), a terminal Spotify client. It's compact, straightforward, well-organized, and asynchronousâ€”a great resource for learning.

### 4. Command Line Rust

Designed to accompany the book `Command-Line Rust (O'Reilly)`, [this project](https://github.com/kyclark/command-line-rust) demonstrates how to create small CLIs (clones of `head`, `cat`, `ls`).

### 5. pngme Book

[This book](https://jrdngr.github.io/pngme_book/) guides you in developing a command-line program that allows you to conceal secret messages in PNG files. The primary goal is to get you coding, with the secondary goal of encouraging you to delve into documentation.

### 6. Writing an OS in Rust

Follow [this blog series](https://os.phil-opp.com) that constructs a small operating system in Rust. Each post serves as a tutorial with all necessary code included. You can also find the source code on the corresponding [GitHub repository](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os).

### 7. CodeCrafters.io: Build Your Own Git, Docker, SQLite, or Redis

On [CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io/for/rust), embark on recreating your favorite developer tools from scratch. It offers a hands-on, minimally-guided approach to mastering Rust while gaining insights into the internals and documentation of everyday technologies.

### 8. mini-redis

[mini-redis](https://github.com/tokio-rs/mini-redis) stands as an incomplete Redis client and server implementation using tokio. With a decent codebase and detailed explanations, it is highly suitable for learning Rust and asynchronous programming.

### 9. Writing Interpreters in Rust

[This online book](https://rust-hosted-langs.github.io/book/) will walk you through the basics of interpreted language implementation in Rust, with a focus on challenges specific to using Rust.
